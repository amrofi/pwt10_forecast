# pwt10_forecast
This is the code for a time series forecast application in R-Shiny. It forecasts the output-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in million 2017 USD) with Penn World Table 10.0 data for 6 Latin American countries. Also, this corresponds to the final course project for the "Developing Data Products" course on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University.
